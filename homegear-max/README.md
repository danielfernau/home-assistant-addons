# Homegear as a Hassio add-on

This add-on repository contains the Homegear add-on for Hassio (Home Assistant).

## Installation

Add this repo to Hassio as [described here](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/) and install the **Homegear** add-on.

Don't get nervous after you've hit **Install**. Depending on your hardware, it may take up to half an hour before Homegear is installed. Once it appears in the list of installed add-ons, you'll have to **open** and **start** it.

To use a TI CC1101 Module for eQ-3 MAX!, export the necessary GPIO pins before starting the add-on:  
```bash
echo 2 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo 25 > /sys/class/gpio/export
```

## Plugins
- max
- influxdb
- management
- webssh
- adminui
- ui

## How it works

A folder named `homegear/` will be added to the `/config` directory of your Hassio installation. `/config` is where all your other Home Assistant config files live as well. You can [access it via Samba](https://home-assistant.io/addons/samba/) for example. `/config/homegear` corresponds to `/etc/homegear` in Homegear. You will need to add your configuration according to the [Homegear docs](https://doc.homegear.eu/data/homegear/configuration.html).

Homegear usually stores its database and other variable data in `/var/lib/homegear`. This directory will be mapped to `/share/homegear/lib` in Hassio. **It is advisable to perform backups of this folder!**

Homegear logs will be in `/share/homegear/log`.

## Limitations

Works for meâ„¢, but your mileage may vary. I've tested Homematic/MAX! with an Raspberry Pi 3 and an [SCC](http://busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=SCC) so far.

This add-on will only work on Raspberry Pi due to the fact that the `resin/rpi-raspbian:stretch` base image is used.

Pull requests are *very* welcome, especially to make this add-on work on other platforms.
